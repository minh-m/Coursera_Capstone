    "Berlin is the capital and largest city of Germany by both area and population. It hosts an exciting art and nightlife scene and, best of all, it is very affordable to live in. While looking for an apartment, you can get easily lost in the decision of which neighborhood suits you best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Berlin is divided into 12 different neighbourhoods (Bezirke in German), with each of it having its own vibe and feel. Nevertheless, this project aims to analyze different neighborhoods of Berlin by exploring venues surrounding the public transport stations and describe different clusters of the neighborhoods. The Berlin-all-inclusive public transport system consists of U-Bahn (underground railway), S-Bahn (elevated railway), buses, and trams, which are managed by The Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) and the Deutsche Bahn (DB). In the scope of this work I focused on **exploring and clustering venues surrounding the U-Bahn (173) and S-Bahn (166) stations**, which make a total of 339 stations.\n",
